rules:
1) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2) Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3) All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Really basic version of the Game of Life

On input enter x/y ( including / )

Enjoy!
